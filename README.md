ChemCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive chemical tasks.

Built with Langchain, it uses a collection of chemical tools including RDKit, paper-qa, as well as some relevant databases in chemistry, like Pubchem and chem-space.

## ü§ó Try it out in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/doncamilom/ChemCrow)!

[![ChemCrow Demo](assets/hf-demo.png)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/doncamilom/ChemCrow)


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This package does not contain all the tools described in the [ChemCrow paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05376) because
of API usage restrictions. This repo will not give the same results as that paper.

All the experiments have been released under [ChemCrow runs](https://github.com/ur-whitelab/chemcrow-runs).


## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

```
pip install chemcrow
```

## üî• Usage
First set up your API keys in your environment.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

You can optionally use Serp API:

```
export SERP_API_KEY=your-serpapi-api-key
```

In a Python session:
```python
from chemcrow.agents import ChemCrow

chem_model = ChemCrow(model="gpt-4-0613", temp=0.1, streaming=False)
chem_model.run("What is the molecular weight of tylenol?")
```

### üíª Running using local LLMs.

ChemCrow also supports the use of local LLMs, through either GPT4All, or HuggingFace's [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index).

#### GPT4All

To run using GPT4All, you will need to download one of the [supported models](https://gpt4all.io/index.html).

```python
from chemcrow.agents import ChemCrow

chem_model = ChemCrow(
    model_type='gpt4all',
    model="./models/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf",
    temp=0.1,
    max_tokens=100,
    verbose=False,
)
```

#### TGI

The other option is Text Generation Interface. This allows you to serve a model and run inference as an API.
To deploy a model, you will need docker. Run it as explained [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/quicktour).

```python
from chemcrow.agents import ChemCrow

agent = ChemCrow(
    model_type='tgi',
    model_server_url='http://server-ip-address:8080',
    temp=0.3,
    max_tokens=40,
    max_iterations=3,
).agent_executor
```

The advantage of TGI is improved efficiency, plus easy access to any model available in HuggingFace.
